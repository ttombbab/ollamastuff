# Ollama Modelfiles for Raspberry Pi 4

This repository contains a collection of `Modelfile` configurations for use with [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), specifically tailored for smaller language models that can run effectively on a Raspberry Pi 4.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide pre-configured `Modelfile` examples for various smaller language models, making it easier to experiment with different options on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi 4.

## Contents

The repository includes the following `Modelfile` examples:

* **`modefile`**: A generic example `Modelfile` with basic configurations. This can serve as a starting point for your own customizations.
* **`modefile-3b`**: A `Modelfile` configured for a language model with approximately 3 billion parameters. These models are generally lighter and more suitable for devices with limited RAM.
* **`modefile-3bllama`**: A `Modelfile` specifically configured for a 3 billion parameter Llama-based model (or similar architecture).
* **`modefile-all`**: This `Modelfile` has every available parameter in an Ollama `Modelfile` explicitly set to its default value. This is intended as a reference for understanding all possible configuration options.
* **`modefile-bloke-coder`**: A `Modelfile` likely configured for a coding-focused model from the "Bloke" model family (often optimized for specific tasks or datasets).
* **`modefile-coder`**: A generic `Modelfile` intended for coding-related language models.
* **`modefile-coder2`**, **`modefile-coder3`**, **`modefile-coder4`**, **`modefile-coder5`**, **`modefile-coder6`**: These are likely experimental `Modelfile` configurations for different coding models or variations of the same model, possibly with different parameters or base models.
* **`modefile-creative`**: A `Modelfile` configured for models designed for creative writing or imaginative tasks.
* **`modefile-creative-quin`**: Similar to `modefile-creative`, but the "-quin" suffix likely indicates an experiment involving quantization (e.g., using a 4-bit or 5-bit quantization for reduced memory usage).
* **`modefile-engineer`**: A `Modelfile` potentially optimized for technical or engineering-related language tasks.
* **`modefile-engineer-quin`**: Similar to `modefile-engineer`, with the "-quin" suffix suggesting quantization experiments.
* **`modefile-fugawy`**: This likely refers to a specific, potentially smaller or experimental model known as "fugawy".
* **`modefile-gemma`**: A `Modelfile` configured for a model from the Google Gemma family, which includes smaller, efficient models.
* **`modefile-hippy`**: This might be a `Modelfile` for a more relaxed or general-purpose language model.
* **`modefile-hippy-quin`**: Similar to `modefile-hippy`, with the "-quin" suffix indicating quantization experiments.
* **`modefile-newcoder`**: Another `Modelfile` focused on coding-related tasks, possibly representing a different model or configuration than the other "coder" variants.
* **`modefile-phi`**: A `Modelfile` configured for a model from the Microsoft Phi family, known for its smaller size and strong performance on certain tasks.
* **`modefile-relax`**: Similar to `modefile-hippy`, potentially configured for general conversation or less demanding tasks.
* **`modefile-relax-quin`**: Similar to `modefile-relax`, with the "-quin" suffix indicating quantization experiments.
* **`modefile2`**, **`modefile3`**: These are likely additional generic or experimental `Modelfile` configurations.

## Usage

To use these `Modelfile`s with Ollama on your Raspberry Pi 4:

1.  **Install Ollama:** If you haven't already, follow the installation instructions for your Raspberry Pi 4 on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.ai/).

2.  **Download the `Modelfile`:** Navigate to the repository in your terminal and download the specific `Modelfile` you want to use. For example, to use `modefile-3b`:

    ```bash
    wget [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/)[your_username]/ollamastuff/main/modefile-3b -O Modelfile
    ```

    **(Replace `[your_username]` with your GitHub username and adjust the branch if necessary)**

    Alternatively, you can clone the entire repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your_username]/ollamastuff.git
    cd ollamastuff
    ```

3.  **Build the model in Ollama:** Once you have the `Modelfile` in your desired directory, use the `ollama create` command to build the model:

    ```bash
    ollama create my-custom-model -f Modelfile
    ```

    Replace `my-custom-model` with the name you want to give to your model.

4.  **Run the model:** After the model is created, you can run it using the `ollama run` command:

    ```bash
    ollama run my-custom-model
    ```

    Again, replace `my-custom-model` with the name you chose in the previous step.

## Considerations for Raspberry Pi 4

Running language models on a Raspberry Pi 4 can be resource-intensive. Keep the following in mind:

* **RAM Limitations:** The Raspberry Pi 4 typically has 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB of RAM. Smaller models (like the 3b variants) are more likely to run successfully. Larger models may require more RAM than available, leading to slow performance or crashes.
* **Quantization (Quin Suffix):** The `Modelfile`s with the "-quin" suffix likely explore the use of quantization techniques. Quantization reduces the memory footprint of the model, making it more suitable for devices with limited RAM, potentially at the cost of some accuracy.
* **Experimentation:** Finding the right balance between model size, performance, and resource usage on a Raspberry Pi 4 often involves experimentation. These `Modelfile`s provide a starting point for your exploration.
* **Swap Space:** Consider enabling and configuring swap space on your Raspberry Pi 4 to provide additional virtual memory, although this will be significantly slower than RAM.
